# Predictive Risk Assessment Model

## Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict healthcare members at high risk of hospitalization. The goal is to enable proactive interventions, improving healthcare outcomes and reducing costs.

---

## Objectives
- Predict high-risk members based on demographic and health data.
- Provide actionable insights to healthcare management teams.
- Enable targeted care plans to reduce hospitalizations.

---

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Python and PySpark.
- Logistic regression model with performance metrics.
- Deployment-ready Python scripts for risk prediction.

---

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Languages:** Python, PySpark
- **Libraries:** pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Cloud Services:** AWS RDS
- **Modeling:** Logistic regression
